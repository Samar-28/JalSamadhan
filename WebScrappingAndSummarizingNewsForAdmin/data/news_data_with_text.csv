Jackie Thomas wrote on Facebook “Heartbreaking news. RIP. Heartfelt thoughts with family and friends, fly high,” while Teresa Wilson added “What has this world become? So sad, RIP.”

Trish Connor wrote “Condolences to Alison’s family. I hope you find the culprits quickly,” while KellyAnne Walsh commented “Shocking,” and Els Rach wrote “How very sad.” Samantha Curtis added “Another one. What is Blackpool coming to?” while Tracey Jenkinson commented “Very sad. Her poor family. Scary place we live in nowadays.”

June Stoodley said “RIP Alison, fly high, will get justice for you,” while Heather O Hanlon said “RIP Alison, you were a true diamond.”

The murder investigation comes off the back of other recent incidents in the Gynn Square area, with police having also found a man in his 50s found dead inside a flat.

Three police cars, including a crime scene investigation team, and a private ambulance were seen close to Warbreck Hill last Thursday September 21 but, following police investigations, officers now believe his death was non suspicious.

There was also extensive recent police and forensic activity in the Seafield Road area in connection with the murder of Eddie Forrester."

Reply

The remnants of former Tropical Storm Ophelia are moving north out of Maryland Sunday, with another 1 to 2 inches of rain forecast in the Baltimore region. A coastal flooding warning is in effect for Anne Arundel and Baltimore counties, the NWS said. (NOAA)

MARYLAND — The remnants of former Tropical Storm Ophelia are moving north out of Maryland Sunday, with another 1 to 2 inches of rain forecast in the Baltimore region. Coastal flooding is possible in Anne Arundel and Baltimore counties, and about 3,000 people in the state are without power.

At 5 a.m., the center of post-Tropical Cyclone Ophelia was located about 85 miles south of Washington, D.C. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 25 mph with higher gusts and was moving north-northeast at 12 mph. Wind and flood advisories have expired, although a coastal flood warning is in effect until 6 p.m. for Baltimore, Anne Arundel and St. Mary's counties until 5 p.m. Up to one half foot of inundation above ground level in low-lying areas due to tidal flooding is expected in southern Baltimore County and the city of Baltimore. Tides 2 to 2.5 feet above normal are forecast.

The most power outages are reported in Anne Arundel County, where 1,257 customers were without power at 9:30 a.m. Sunday, according to PowerOutage.US. Organizers of Artscape in Baltimore, which was canceled on Saturday, said festivities are back on from noon to 5 p.m. Sunday.

While the storm moves on, it won't be great beach weather on the Eastern Shore. ""Swells generated by Ophelia will continue to affect much of the East Coast of the United States through today,"" the NWS said. ""These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions."" The weather this week will feel more like fall, with daily high temperatures in the upper 60s through Wednesday before inching into the low 70s at the end of the week.

Here's the latest Maryland forecast: Sunday: Rain, mainly before 11am. High near 69. East wind 6 to 10 mph becoming southwest in the afternoon. Chance of precipitation is 80%. New precipitation amounts between a quarter and half of an inch possible.

Sunday Night: A chance of rain before 8pm, then a slight chance of showers after 8pm. Mostly cloudy, with a low around 60. Northwest wind around 7 mph. Chance of precipitation is 30%. Monday: A slight chance of showers after 2pm. Cloudy, with a high near 69. North wind 8 to 10 mph. Chance of precipitation is 20%. Monday Night: A chance of showers, mainly after 8pm. Cloudy, with a low around 58. Northeast wind 11 to 13 mph, with gusts as high as 18 mph. Chance of precipitation is 40%. Tuesday: A slight chance of showers. Mostly cloudy, with a high near 68. Northeast wind around 14 mph, with gusts as high as 20 mph. Chance of precipitation is 20%. Tuesday Night: A slight chance of showers before 2am. Mostly cloudy, with a low around 56. Chance of precipitation is 20%."
