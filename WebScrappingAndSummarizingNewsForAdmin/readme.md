Here, I am to complete the AI/ML prototype for WebScrapping and then summarizing the news for admin.
I this feature we are trying to implement-
Webscrapping from GoogleNews in python.
Sorting the News in order of their correctness.
Storing top 10 news in excess.
Dividing news in tokens of maximum api limit and then we will try to use any openai api to summarize the entire news.
Finally, I have planned to create the api for this model and then it can be easily integrated with backend and frontend.
These are the steps for implementing this feature, written after a lot of research.
